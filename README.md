# udacity_cpp_developer
C++ developer nanodegree program on Udacity

# Setup - Linux
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install gdb
```

I also recommend using VSCode with the "C/C++" and "Clang-Format" extensions.

I created a conda environment to enable C++ in Jupyter Notebook. See installation instructions here: https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling
